# AdaptiveTransportMaps: ATM 

## What is the ATM algorithm?

Package contains algorithms for learning triangular transport maps given access to samples from a target density or evaluations of the target.

This sofware has been developed and is being maintained by the Uncertainty Quantification Group at MIT, under the guidance of Prof. Youssef Marzouk.
